* The whole test should not take you longer than ~30-60 minutes. Please make sure you don't take much longer than that from start to finish.
* If you don't know the answer just skip the question! Please don't just guess.
* If you are not sure you understood the question just skip the question.
* Try not to find the correct answers in the web somewhere. It's not about getting as much answers correct, it's about finding out (also for yourself) what concepts and knowlage you know by heart.
* Feel free to add comments if you think a question does not make sense.
* If this whole test makes no sense to you, please let us know!
